This Python script evaluates the quality of roof models on LOD2 building 3D models obtained from https://www.geoportal.gov.pl. 
It calculates the distance between the roof geometry and planes generated by fitting the provided point cloud (.laz file) data. It also displays simple 2D visualisation of the distances(errors) in matplotlib.
